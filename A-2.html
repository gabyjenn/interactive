Smillie knowingly kept a logbook in which he registered all the images he took, listing the date, the image number and (I am only guessing here) the subject of the photograph. Unfortunately, the logbook is now lost. I have tried to find it on several of my site-visits, hoping it would miraculously appear. I tracked down Smillie's log numbers in the digital database of the archives. Yet the collection has not been fully digitized and so many of the cyanotypes are not registered in the catalogue, while the institutional captioning often remains shadowy. Missing image; missing caption; wrong caption; different title; same number; different image. This book is perhaps my attempt to reconstruct the lost logbook by attributing images to captions and moving through the gaps in the archive, looking at how an institution archiving itself can never fully achieve the task. Every time I dare to name what is in an image, I have lost. What remains are lists of captions, phantoms of captures and ghosts of other images.<br></p>
<p>I intended to make a book of images with not just one beginning and one end but with many of both. With this loop - like the one of the film reel or the rotating drum in the gun - finding its rhythm in the flipping through the pages, and the loop in each iteration of an image and in the grain. I like the idea of the reader being lost in the noise, in those dots, in the materiality of the printed images, the same way that I often got lost scanning over images in the archives. Objects of attention captured from afar or above in the eyes of the photographer, the sources of which remain unclear without the logbook to guide us.
One can then only associate. Let the form migrate from one spread to the other. Ghost images, ghost captures: like Warburg's Atlas, the more one looks at the images, the more one starts concentrating on the space between them. The succession of images functions like montage. It creates a film, one that takes place in the act of reading, and in the manipulation of the pages themselves. (I repeat:the cost of film was cheaper than ammunition.) Thanks to the photocopy machine, quite similar to the one I encountered in the Smithsonian reading room, each image gained in grain and in noise and, in a sense, in depth. As the layers accumulated through this mechanical reproduction process, they acquired new narratives.<br></p>
<p>Questions around what is being excluded or not in the collection emerge as much as the conflicting tension between the desire of an official narrative (as written by the institution) and the many other unofficial narratives embedded within the image's own history. I should add that I have never spent so much time stalking men, tracing them, or sneaking at their back - usually dedicating my practice instead to tracing the absence of women in official historiography.<br>
The last full spread gives us the last reproduction of a cyanotype: an original print exposed from the negative, yet in reverse. It reads upside-down "Clean (Glass of the vitrine)," bringing us back to the reverse/mirrored image in the daguerreotype apparatus that opens the book, looping back to the display cabinets at the beginning of the sequence. This reverse image is like looking through the lens before the photographer presses the shutter.<br>
Shutters and stutters. I see the montage of the images being language, the noise in the images clumsily yet fiercely creating sentences:<br>
<i>Stuttering, also known as stammering and dysphemia, is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words, or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds.</i></p>
